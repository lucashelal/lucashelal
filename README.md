# Hi, I'm Lucas - aka Luquinhas. ðŸ‘‹

### Epidemiologist | Bachelor Candidate in Civil Engineering | Master of Science, Doctor of Philosophy

> Areas: _Urban Infrastructure_ & _Data Engineering_ 

Be welcome to my GitHub profile! Here I share my projects and random ideas on **urban infrastructure**, de **public health**, **data engineering** and any _unforeseen_ topic that may occur over time related to the __populational net benefit__ we can deliver through evidence-based and data-driven policies. That reflects my expertise as an **epidemiology** far more than 10 years and the skill I'm learning now - **civil engineering**. All througout the code beyond the logics.

1. ðŸŒŽ _In-depth_

   + 1.1 _Data-Driven Urban Infrastructure_: Exploring how infrastructure improvements can enhance access to services and overall well-being.
   + 1.2 _Health Indicators & Urbanization_: Investigating causal relationships between urban environments and public health outcomes using advanced statistical models.
   + 1.3 _Open-Source Projects_: Working on tools, models and open to colaborate on any of the topics aforementioned. Also an open-science enthusiast and advocate.

2. ðŸš€ _Key Projects_: to be updated.


3. ðŸ“š _Some skills_

   + 3.1 _Programming Languages_: C/C++, FORTRAN, Matlab, R/Python and Java/PHP (dummy!)
   + 3.2 _Tools & Frameworks_: Git, LaTeX, VSCode, iText, Linux
   + 3.3 _Computer Aided Tools_: AutoCAD, AutoCAD 3D, BricsCAD, TransCAD, LTSpice, GIS
   + 3.4 _Methodologies_: Data Analysis, Causal Inference, Infrastructure Modeling, Strutuctural Design, Project Management
   + 3.5 _Technologies_: Statistical modeling, forecasting models, econometric models, algebra, calculus, technical drawing, technical writing

4. ðŸ“ˆ _Statistics_

5. ðŸŒ± _Currently Learning_
   
   + 5.1 Advanced methods for **urban infrastructure metrics**
   + 5.2 **Predictive models** for traffic and health indicators
   + 5.3 **Python for data visualization** with Streamlit dashboards
